killjoy
=======

killjoy is a systemd unit monitoring application.

Concepts
--------

To understand killjoy, one must first understand systemd:

> systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and
> service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system.
>
> â€” [systemd](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/)

Units are the resources that systemd knows how to manage. For example, here are several units
which might be present on a host, and the resources they represent:

* `nginx.service`: Lightweight HTTP server and IMAP/POP3 proxy server
* `logrotate.service`: Rotate log files
* `logrotate.timer`: Rotate log files daily (i.e. periodically trigger `logrotate.service`)
* `boot.mount`: The `/boot` mount point

This list of units is small; a host can have many hundreds of units, of eleven different types.

There can be multiple systemd instances running on a host at a given time. Typically, there is
one system-wide instance, and one instance per logged-in user. Each systemd instance maintains
distinct units.

When killjoy starts, it reads a list of rules, where each rule declares units that killjoy should
watch. For example, rules might state:

* Connect to the system bus and watch `nginx.service`. If it enters the "failed" state, contact
  the "logfile" notifier.
* Connect to the session bus and watch all `.timer` units. If any enter the "active" state,
  contact the "notification" notifier.

A notifier is an application that knows how to consume a D-Bus message from killjoy. The clear
separation between killjoy and the notifiers means that anyone may write a notifier at any time,
in whichever language they wish, to do whatever they want, and with no coordination from the
killjoy development team. Two notifiers are developed in conjunction with killjoy, and they are
small enough to be easily studied:

* [killjoy Notifier: Logfile](https://github.com/Ichimonji10/killjoy-notifier-logfile)
* [killjoy Notifier: Notification](https://github.com/Ichimonji10/killjoy-notifier-notification)

For further conceptual information, see
[systemd(1)](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.html),
especially the section on [concepts].

Alternatives
------------

killjoy is inspired by
[sagbescheid](https://sagbescheid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
[SystemdMon](https://github.com/joonty/systemd_mon),
[pynagsystemd](https://github.com/kbytesys/pynagsystemd), and
[`OnFailure=`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html),
but there are differences in features, reliability, and efficiency. Of special
note:

* killjoy lets a user write generic rules, like "monitor all `.timer` units." This is in contrast
  to the case where a user must explicitly state every unit to be monitored. Furthermore, units
  may appear or disappear at runtime, e.g. when a package is installed or uninstalled, and
  killjoy correctly handles these events.
* killjoy is cleanly separated from notifiers. Users aren't restricted to the notifiers bundled
  with killjoy.

Installation
------------

Arch Linux users may install using the
[killjoy-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/killjoy-git/) AUR package. A
stable package will be created when killjoy further matures.

All other users may install killjoy from source. To do so:

1.   Ensure systemd, D-Bus, and the rust compiler are installed. On distributions which
     separately package libdbus, install that. (On Ubuntu, this is `libdbus-1-dev`.)
2.   Get the source code, and compile and install it:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Ichimonji10/killjoy.git
     cd killjoy
     scripts/install.sh
     ```

Configuration
-------------

Configuration files are searched for as per the [XDG Base Directory
Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).
The first one found is used. A sample configuration file is as follows:

```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "rules": [
        {
            "bus_type": "session",
            "active_states": ["activating", "active", "deactivating", "inactive", "failed"],
            "expression": "foo.service",
            "expression_type": "unit name",
            "notifiers": ["logfile", "notification"]
        }
    ],
    "notifiers": {
        "logfile": {
            "bus_type": "session",
            "bus_name": "name.jerebear.KilljoyNotifierLogfile1"
        },
        "notification": {
            "bus_type": "session",
            "bus_name": "name.jerebear.KilljoyNotifierNotification1"
        }
    }
}
```

The contents of the settings file may be validated with `killjoy settings validate`.

The meaning of the configuration file is as follows:

*    `version` defines how the rest of the configuration file is interpreted. There is currently
     one configuration file format, and this key should always be set to 1.
*    `rules` is a list of rules stating which units should be monitored. For each rule:
     *   `bus_type` defines which D-Bus buses killjoy shall connect to in search of systemd
         instances. It may be `session` or `system`.
     *   All possible `active_states` are listed above; see [systemd(1)] for details.
     *   `expression_type` and `expression` define which units should be monitored (out of all
         the units killjoy discovers when talking to systemd). If `expression_type` is:
         *   `unit name`, then `expression` should be an exact unit name, like `foo.service`.
         *   `unit type`, then `expression` should be a unit suffix, like `.service`.
         *   `regex`, then `expression` should be a [regex](https://docs.rs/crate/regex/) like
             `^f[aeiou]{2}\.service$`. Note the presence of the line begin and
             end anchors, `^` and `$`.
     *   `notifiers` is a list of notifier labels.
*    `notifiers` is a map, where keys are notifier labels, and values define how to contact that
     notifier.
     *   `bus_type` defines which message bus killjoy should connect to when sending a message to
         this notifier.
     *   `bus_name` defines the bus name (i.e. address) of the notifier on the message bus.

Usage
-----

The typical way to use killjoy is to let it automatically start on login:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now killjoy.service
```

killjoy may also be invoked manually. Execute `killjoy` to run killjoy in the foreground, or
`killjoy --help` to learn about its features.
