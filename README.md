killjoy
=======

Monitor systemd units.

killjoy is a systemd unit monitoring application. It discovers systemd units and
tracks their states. When a unit changes to a state of interest, killjoy
contacts notifiers. Examples of notifiers include:

* [killjoy Notifier:
  Logfile](https://github.com/Ichimonji10/killjoy-notifier-logfile)
* [killjoy Notifier:
  Notification](https://github.com/Ichimonji10/killjoy-notifier-notification)

Concepts
--------

To understand killjoy, one must first understand systemd:

> systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a
> system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the
> system.
>
> â€” [systemd](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/)

Units are the resources that systemd knows how to manage. For example, here are
several units which might be present on a host, and the resources they
represent:

* `nginx.service`: Lightweight HTTP server and IMAP/POP3 proxy server
* `logrotate.service`: Rotate log files
* `logrotate.timer`: Rotate log files daily (i.e. periodically trigger
  `logrotate.service`)
* `boot.mount`: The `/boot` mount point

This list of units is small; a host can have many hundreds of units, of eleven
different types.

There can be multiple systemd instances running on a host at a given time.
Typically, there is one system-wide instance, and one instance per logged-in
user. Each systemd instance maintains distinct units.

When killjoy starts, it reads a list of rules, where each rule declares units
that killjoy should watch. For example, rules might state:

* Connect to the system bus and watch `nginx.service`. If it enters the "failed"
  state, contact the "logfile" notifier.
* Connect to the session bus and watch all `.timer` units. If any enter the
  "active" state, contact the "notification" notifier.

A notifier is an application that knows how to consume a D-Bus message from
killjoy. The clear separation between killjoy and the notifiers means that
anyone may write a notifier at any time, in whichever language they wish, to do
whatever they want, and with no coordination from the killjoy development team.
Two notifiers are developed in conjunction with killjoy, and they are small
enough to be easily studied:

* [killjoy Notifier: Logfile](https://github.com/Ichimonji10/killjoy-notifier-logfile)
* [killjoy Notifier: Notification](https://github.com/Ichimonji10/killjoy-notifier-notification)

For further conceptual information, see
[systemd(1)](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.html),
especially the section on
[concepts](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.html#Concepts).

Alternatives
------------

killjoy is inspired by
[sagbescheid](https://sagbescheid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
[SystemdMon](https://github.com/joonty/systemd_mon),
[pynagsystemd](https://github.com/kbytesys/pynagsystemd), and
[`OnFailure=`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html),
but there are differences in features, reliability, and efficiency. Of special
note:

* killjoy lets a user write generic rules, like "monitor all `.timer` units."
  This is in contrast to the case where a user must explicitly state every unit
  to be monitored. Furthermore, units may appear or disappear at runtime, e.g.
  when a package is installed or uninstalled, and killjoy correctly handles
  these events.
* killjoy is cleanly separated from notifiers. Users aren't restricted to the
  notifiers bundled with killjoy.

Installation
------------

Arch Linux users may install using the
[killjoy-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/killjoy-git/) AUR package. A
stable package will be created when killjoy further matures.

Rust developers may install this app with `cargo install killjoy`. Note that
libdbus must be installed. (On Ubuntu, this is provided by the `libdbus-1-dev`
package.)

Configuration
-------------

killjoy searches for a configuration file at `killjoy/settings.json` as per the
[XDG Base Directory
Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html),
and the first one found is used. In practice, this means that the configuration
file should typically be installed at `~/.config/killjoy/settings.json`.

A sample configuration file is as follows:

```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "rules": [
        {
            "bus_type": "session",
            "active_states": ["activating", "active", "deactivating", "inactive", "failed"],
            "expression": "foo.service",
            "expression_type": "unit name",
            "notifiers": ["logfile", "notification"]
        }
    ],
    "notifiers": {
        "logfile": {
            "bus_type": "session",
            "bus_name": "name.jerebear.KilljoyNotifierLogfile1"
        },
        "notification": {
            "bus_type": "session",
            "bus_name": "name.jerebear.KilljoyNotifierNotification1"
        }
    }
}
```

The contents of the settings file may be validated with `killjoy settings
validate`.

The meaning of the configuration file is as follows:

*    `version` defines how the rest of the configuration file is interpreted.
     There is currently one configuration file format, and this key should
     always be set to 1.
*    `rules` is a list of rules stating which units should be monitored. For
     each rule:
     *   `bus_type` defines which D-Bus buses killjoy shall connect to in search
         of systemd instances. It may be `session` or `system`.
     *   All possible `active_states` are listed above; see
         [systemd(1)](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.html)
         for details.
     *   `expression_type` and `expression` define which units should be
         monitored (out of all the units killjoy discovers when talking to
         systemd). If `expression_type` is:
         *   `unit name`, then `expression` should be an exact unit name, like
             `foo.service`.
         *   `unit type`, then `expression` should be a unit suffix, like
             `.service`.
         *   `regex`, then `expression` should be a [regex](https://docs.rs/crate/regex/) like
             `^f[aeiou]{2}\.service$`. Note the presence of the line begin and
             end anchors, `^` and `$`.
     *   `notifiers` is a list of notifier labels.
*    `notifiers` is a map, where keys are notifier labels, and values define how
     to contact that notifier.
     *   `bus_type` defines which message bus killjoy should connect to when
         sending a message to this notifier.
     *   `bus_name` defines the bus name (i.e. address) of the notifier on the
         message bus.

Usage
-----

The typical way to use killjoy is to let it automatically start on login:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now killjoy.service
```

killjoy may also be invoked manually. Execute `killjoy` to run killjoy in the
foreground, or `killjoy --help` to learn about its features.

Changelog
---------

This section lists the notable changes in each release.

### Unreleased

Improve installation instructions.

### 0.1.1

Fix a documentation error. See
[#20](https://github.com/Ichimonji10/killjoy/issues/20).

### 0.1.0

Initial release. Anecdotally, killjoy is stable enough to be useful for personal
use. One major breaking change is likely to land in a future release: [issue
 #13](https://github.com/Ichimonji10/killjoy/issues/13). This release is being
pushed out anyway so as to make documentation more accessible, and to ease
packaging.
