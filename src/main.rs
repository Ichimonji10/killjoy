 * Monitor systemd units.
 *
 * killjoy is a systemd unit monitoring application. It discovers systemd units and tracks their
 * states. When a unit changes to a state of interest, killjoy generates notifications via
 * notifiers. Examples of notifiers include:
 *
 * * [killjoy Notifier: Logfile]
 * * [killjoy Notifier: Notification]
 *
 * Concepts
 * --------
 *
 * To understand killjoy, one must first understand systemd:
 *
 * > systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and
 * > service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system.
 * >
 * > â€” [systemd]
 *
 * Units are the resources that systemd knows how to manage. For example, here are several units
 * which might be present on a host, and the resources they represent:
 *
 * * `nginx.service`: Lightweight HTTP server and IMAP/POP3 proxy server
 * * `logrotate.service`: Rotate log files
 * * `logrotate.timer`: Rotate log files daily (i.e. periodically trigger `logrotate.service`)
 * * `boot.mount`: The `/boot` mount point
 *
 * This list of units is small; a host can have many hundreds of units, of eleven different types.
 *
 * There can be multiple systemd instances running on a host at a given time. Typically, there is
 * one system-wide instance, and one instance per logged-in user. Each systemd instance maintains
 * distinct units.
 *
 * When killjoy starts, it reads a list of rules, where each rule declares units that killjoy should
 * watch. For example, rules might state:
 *
 * * Connect to the system bus and watch `nginx.service`. If it enters the "failed" state, contact
 *   the "logfile" notifier.
 * * Connect to the session bus and watch all `.timer` units. If any enter the "active" state,
 *   contact the "notification" notifier.
 *
 * A notifier is an application that knows how to consume a D-Bus message from killjoy. The clear
 * separation between killjoy and the notifiers means that anyone may write a notifier at any time,
 * in whichever language they wish, to do whatever they want, and with no coordination from the
 * killjoy development team. Two notifiers are developed in conjunction with killjoy, and they are
 * small enough to be easily studied:
 *
 * * [killjoy Notifier: Logfile]
 * * [killjoy Notifier: Notification]
 *
 * For further conceptual information, see [systemd(1)], especially the section on [concepts].
 *
 * Alternatives
 * ------------
 *
 * killjoy is inspired by [sagbescheid], [SystemdMon], [pynagsystemd], and [`OnFailure=`], but there
 * are differences in features, reliability, and efficiency. Of special note:
 *
 * * killjoy lets a user write generic rules, like "monitor all `.timer` units." This is in contrast
 *   to the case where a user must explicitly state every unit to be monitored. Furthermore, units
 *   may appear or disappear at runtime, e.g. when a package is installed or uninstalled, and
 *   killjoy correctly handles these events.
 * * killjoy is cleanly separated from notifiers. Users aren't restricted to the notifiers bundled
 *   with killjoy.
 *
 * Installation
 * ------------
 *
 * Arch Linux users may install using the [killjoy-git] AUR package. A stable package will be
 * created when killjoy further matures.
 *
 * All other users may install killjoy from source. To do so:
 *
 * 1.   Ensure systemd, D-Bus, and the rust compiler are installed. On distributions which
 *      separately package libdbus, install that. (On Ubuntu, this is `libdbus-1-dev`.)
 * 2.   Get the source code, and compile and install it:
 *
 *      ```bash
 *      git clone https://github.com/Ichimonji10/killjoy.git
 *      cd killjoy
 *      scripts/install.sh
 *      ```
 *
 * Configuration
 * -------------
 *
 * Configuration files are searched for as per the [XDG Base Directory Specification]. The first one
 * found is used. A sample configuration file is as follows:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *     "version": 1,
 *     "rules": [
 *         {
 *             "bus_type": "session",
 *             "active_states": ["activating", "active", "deactivating", "inactive", "failed"],
 *             "expression": "foo.service",
 *             "expression_type": "unit name",
 *             "notifiers": ["logfile", "notification"]
 *         }
 *     ],
 *     "notifiers": {
 *         "logfile": {
 *             "bus_type": "session",
 *             "bus_name": "name.jerebear.KilljoyNotifierLogfile1"
 *         },
 *         "notification": {
 *             "bus_type": "session",
 *             "bus_name": "name.jerebear.KilljoyNotifierNotification1"
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The contents of the settings file may be validated with `killjoy settings validate`.
 *
 * The meaning of the configuration file is as follows:
 *
 * *    `version` defines how the rest of the configuration file is interpreted. There is currently
 *      one configuration file format, and this key should always be set to 1.
 * *    `rules` is a list of rules stating which units should be monitored. For each rule:
 *      *   `bus_type` defines which D-Bus buses killjoy shall connect to in search of systemd
 *          instances. It may be `session` or `system`.
 *      *   All possible `active_states` are listed above; see [systemd(1)] for details.
 *      *   `expression_type` and `expression` define which units should be monitored (out of all
 *          the units killjoy discovers when talking to systemd). If `expression_type` is:
 *          *   `unit name`, then `expression` should be an exact unit name, like `foo.service`.
 *          *   `unit type`, then `expression` should be a unit suffix, like `.service`.
 *          *   `regex`, then `expression` should be a [regex] like `^f[aeiou]{2}\.service$`. Note
 *              the presence of the line begin and end anchors, `^` and `$`.
 *      *   `notifiers` is a list of notifier labels.
 * *    `notifiers` is a map, where keys are notifier labels, and values define how to contact that
 *      notifier.
 *      *   `bus_type` defines which message bus killjoy should connect to when sending a message to
 *          this notifier.
 *      *   `bus_name` defines the bus name (i.e. address) of the notifier on the message bus.
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 *
 * The typical way to use killjoy is to let it automatically start on login:
 *
 * ```bash
 * systemctl --user enable --now killjoy.service
 * ```
 *
 * killjoy may also be invoked manually. Execute `killjoy` to run killjoy in the foreground, or
 * `killjoy --help` to learn about its features.
